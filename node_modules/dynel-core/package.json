It can be used for building both web applications or Node.js applications. \n\n - [The Core Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-core) provides the basic building blocks of a Dynamic\n   Elements application.\n - [The Data Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-data) builds on the Core Framework for classes to work\n   with business data, including model objects with well-defined data\n   types, and collections.\n - [The UI Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-ui) provides support for building UI elements for your\n   web applications that can be tied to your business data.\n\n\n**Getting Started**\n---\n\n**For Node.js Applications**\n\nTo get started, you just need to install the dynel-core package and it's dependencies:\n\n    npm install dynel-core\n\n\n\n**For Web Applications**\n\nDynamic Elements uses the CommonJS module specification, which is not currently supported as-is in browsers. In order to run a Dynamic Elements application in the browser, it needs to be compiled into a browser-friendly JavaScript file (or set of JavaScript files). We will eventually provide pre-compiled versions that can be used for building browser-based JavaScript applications, but for now your code needs to be compiled and packaged with the Dynamic Elements library using browserify, or another similar package.\n\n\n",
